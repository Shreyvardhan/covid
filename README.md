An analysis of the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States. For Gov 1005 at Harvard.

Description: Analysis of COVID-19, the disease that has literally taken over all our lives. I was particularly interested in three things: mapping the rapid spread of the coronavirus across the U.S, measuring the second order impacts of the disease, due to lockdowns and disruptions, and analysing the change in public opinion over the course of the disease.

Sources: Data has been gathered from multiple sources. Mapping data is from The New York Times, along with some county geographical sourced from Wikipedia. Approval ratings for President Trump are from FiveThirtyEight. Restaurant bookins data has been sourced from OpenTable; flight data from FlightRadar24; unemployment insurance data from the Department of Labor, and search data from Google Trends.
